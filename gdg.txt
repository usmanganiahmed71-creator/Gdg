Usman Gani Ahmed for gdg cybersecurity

Solution for ctf
part 1 
open app.py and notice the secret key is probably in base 64 and then try to use decode function as shown in the example to decode the hint
after that I tried to see through the git files which are hidden files and saw a uncommited change with a weird commit msg 
found part 1 of flag gdg{sw1ss_ and the api key :dont_redeem_it 
also noticed that the api key changed later to fake_key_123456
I did notice the hidden Cyrillic and latin characters in xotwod file but could not crack what I assume to be SNOW style message due to the wrong key 
I also notice that the decoy file may have also hidden some key but I couldn’t find it
ctf 3:
I tried using automated scanning and it only cam up with a a small part gg1ol}
I was unfortunately unable to open the other vmbox file for some reason
